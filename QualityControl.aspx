            <p>
                We have strict quality control procedures that are implemented to ensure the whole concrete pipe manufacturing process is accounted for completely. This includes mixing and batching of concrete, with appropriate aggregates, admixtures.
Quality is the key factor that has enabled us to ride high on the strides of the success. We follow a well defined quality management system as per ISO 9001 and as per IS458 standards .Our quality assurance plan is according to Bureau of Indian Standards. The different stages of quality control include the following:

            <h2 style="margin-left: 450px; color: #c19a05; font-family: Georgia">RAW MATERIAL INSPECTION</h2>
            <p>Raw materials such as cement, steel, stone blast & sand are procured from established vendor’s base. These raw materials inspected at arrival on our factory site. The materials are sent to manufacturing unit only after approval of quality controllers.</p>

                                In this test pipe are tested for their load bearing capacity. The load is applied through a hydraulic jack on the testing bay.
Load is applied in two stages:-

A. LOAD TO PRODUCE 0.25MM CRACK:-
Here load is applied on sample pipe as per Table 3 of IS 458- 2003 and after full application of load, observation is made for surface cracks (>0.25mm Crack Size). If no cracks are observed or cracks are observed which are less than or equal to 0.25mm thick, the sample is then passed prime-facie.
B. ULTIMATE LOAD: - 
Here ultimate load is applied on a sample from the applied lot as per Table 3 of IS 458-2003. Since this a breakdown load test, this test is done by mutual agreement between manufacturer and client. Here the load is observed at the point where the pipes cracks prominently or breaks down

                            <p>In this test, the pipes are tested for detecting the with stand able Hydrostatic Surge pressure when they are laid down in sewers/ culverts. The testing is done by applying hydrostatic pressure artificially by machine on water filled pipe of 0.07 MPA for a period of (1min+30sec for every 10mm thickness of pipe) time. Now the lookout is done for the formation of surface water beads. If water beads are not formed or if the water beads have not grown, then the sample is considered alright. This testing is mostly done for pressure pipes, if at all it is done for non-pressure pipes it is generally 2% of the offered sample lot size.</p>

                            <p>This test is more of a practical application and has been devised by manufacturers throughout the years for Spigot and Socket pipes. Here the Spigot & Socket ends of two pipes are joined together with the rubber ring and artificial mud walls are constructed and water is poured inside the two jointed pipes. If the water is found to stand inside the pipe, with no leakage from the joints, then the joints of the pipes are considered to be leak proof.</p>
